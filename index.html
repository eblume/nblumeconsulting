<h1>Service Structure</h1>

<h2>Initial Free Consultation:</h2>
<p>The first step in our process is to meet with you and discuss
your needs. We believe that a clearly defined project is the key to
an efficient and successful interaction. The output of this consultation is a proposal to you on the scope of work, deliverables, and costs.</p>

<h2>Ways of Working:</h2>
<p>We have an intentionally flexible structure for working with clients.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can be a <b><i>virtualized department</i></b> by which we become your out-sourced operational functions such as HR management or bookkeeping to enable your in-house resources to focus on your mission and key areas. This is typically billed at a monthly rate basis.
    <li>We can be a <b><i>scalable resource</i></b>. As new projects arise that challenge existing capacity, we can be utilized to give your existing programs &amp; services the extra horsepower needed. These projects are typically managed on a defined cost basis.

<h1>Nancy Blume, MNA, PHR</h1>

<p>Nancy Blume has nearly 30 years' experience in the operational support and development of small, mission-driven organizations.</p>

<p>Early in her career and after completing a B.S. in Community Health Education from the Pennsylvania State University, Nancy served as a Volunteer Manager, Project Coordinator, and Community Health Educator for a half-dozen organizations in three states (IL, NJ, and CA). Nancy developed a keen understanding of the "can do" nature and resource efficiency required in small but focused work teams.</p>

<p>Recognizing a strong desire to help small and growing organizations manage their operational support needs, Nancy completed her MNA (Master of Nonprofit Administration) from the University of San Francisco in 2000. She has since deployed that expertise as the director of nonprofit organizations, wearing all of the functional hats typical in such settings. She has also created an HR Department at a large and growing nonprofit (13 sites and approximately 300 employees). Nancy recognized the fundamental need many organizations have to put in place the operational support necessary to drive a mission-oriented vision to success.</p>

<p>Nancy has continued to grow her professional expertise by being certified as a Professional of Human Resources (PHR) since 2009 and is an active member of SHRM. She has recently completed all coursework and examinations to become a Certified Bookkeeper (CB) through the American Institute of Professional Bookkeepers (AIPB).</p>
